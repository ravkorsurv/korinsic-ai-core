# Client Data Quality Gap Assessment Framework

## 🎯 Overview
This framework provides a structured approach to assess current data quality practices at client sites and implement the DQSI scoring system tailored to their specific environment.

## 📋 Phase 1: Current State Assessment

### 1.1 Data Infrastructure Discovery
**What to Assess:**
- **Data Sources**: Trading systems, order management, settlement, reference data
- **Data Flows**: Real-time feeds, batch processes, manual inputs
- **System Architecture**: Producer vs consumer systems identification
- **Integration Points**: APIs, file transfers, databases, message queues

**Key Questions:**
```
• Which systems PRODUCE data (alerts, cases, trades)?
• Which systems CONSUME data for processing?
• What are the critical data feeds and their SLAs?
• Where do data quality issues typically occur?
```

### 1.2 Existing DQ Practices Inventory
**Current Capabilities Assessment:**

| Area | Assessment Questions | DQSI Mapping |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Completeness** | Do you check for missing fields? How? | null_presence, field_population |
| **Conformity** | Do you validate data types and formats? | data_type, format, length, range |
| **Timeliness** | Do you monitor data freshness/delays? | freshness, lag_detection |
| **Coverage** | Do you track volume drops or gaps? | volume_profile, volume_reconciliation |
| **Accuracy** | Do you validate against golden sources? | precision, value_accuracy |
| **Uniqueness** | Do you check for duplicates? | duplicate_detection |
| **Consistency** | Do you validate across systems? | internal_consistency, cross_system_consistency |

### 1.3 Technology Stack Assessment
**Current Tooling:**
- Data quality tools (Informatica, Talend, custom scripts)
- Monitoring systems (alerts, dashboards)
- Data governance platforms
- Testing frameworks
- Configuration management

**Integration Points:**
- APIs for real-time scoring
- Batch processing capabilities
- Alert/case management systems
- Reporting and visualization tools

## 📊 Phase 2: DQSI Configuration Elements

### 2.1 KDE Identification & Risk Mapping
**Client-Specific KDE Discovery:**

```yaml
# Example Client KDE Configuration
kde_risk_tiers:
  # High Risk (weight: 3) - Business Critical
  trader_id: high
  order_timestamp: high
  client_id: high          # If client-facing
  notional: high           # If high-value trading
  
  # Medium Risk (weight: 2) - Important
  trade_time: medium
  quantity: medium
  price: medium
  venue: medium            # If multi-venue
  
  # Low Risk (weight: 1) - Supporting
  desk_id: low
  instrument: low
  settlement_date: low
  
  # Client-Specific KDEs
  regulatory_flag: high    # If heavily regulated
  counterparty: medium     # If counterparty risk focus
  portfolio: low           # If portfolio tracking
```

### 2.2 Strategy Selection Based on Client Profile

#### **Client Type Assessment:**

| Client Profile | Strategy | Rationale |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| **Startup Trading Firm** | Fallback | Limited resources, basic compliance needs |
| **Mid-Size Investment Bank** | Role-Aware (Consumer) | Some validation, foundational focus |
| **Large Investment Bank** | Role-Aware (Producer) | Full validation, regulatory requirements |
| **Regulatory Entity** | Role-Aware (Producer) | Maximum validation, audit trails |

#### **Strategy Configuration:**

```python
# Client Strategy Selection Logic
def determine_client_strategy(client_profile):
    factors = {
        'firm_size': client_profile.get('employee_count', 0),
        'trading_volume': client_profile.get('daily_volume', 0),
        'regulatory_tier': client_profile.get('regulatory_level', 'basic'),
        'it_maturity': client_profile.get('it_sophistication', 'basic'),
        'budget': client_profile.get('dq_budget', 'low')
    }
    
    if factors['regulatory_tier'] == 'tier1_bank':
        return 'role_aware_producer'
    elif factors['firm_size'] > 1000 or factors['trading_volume'] > 1e9:
        return 'role_aware_consumer'  
    else:
        return 'fallback'
```

### 2.3 Sub-Dimension Customization

**Client-Specific Sub-Dimension Selection:**

```yaml
# Example: High-Frequency Trading Firm
sub_dimension_overrides:
  timeliness:
    # Ultra-low latency requirements
    freshness_threshold: "100ms"  # vs standard "1hour"
    lag_detection: enabled
    
  accuracy:
    # Price precision critical
    precision_decimals: 6
    value_accuracy: enabled
    
  uniqueness:
    # Duplicate trade detection critical
    duplicate_detection: enhanced
    cross_system_uniqueness: enabled

# Example: Asset Manager
sub_dimension_overrides:
  completeness:
    # Portfolio data completeness critical
    field_population: strict
    
  consistency:
    # Cross-system portfolio reconciliation
    cross_system_consistency: daily
```

## 🔧 Phase 3: Scoring Calibration

### 3.1 Baseline Establishment

**Historical Data Analysis:**
```python
# Calibration Process
def calibrate_client_scoring(historical_data):
    baseline_metrics = {
        'null_rate': calculate_null_percentage(historical_data),
        'format_error_rate': calculate_format_errors(historical_data),
        'timeliness_p95': calculate_delay_percentile(historical_data, 95),
        'volume_variance': calculate_volume_variance(historical_data)
    }
    
    # Adjust scoring thresholds based on client baseline
    scoring_thresholds = {
        'acceptable_null_rate': baseline_metrics['null_rate'] * 0.8,
        'good_timeliness': baseline_metrics['timeliness_p95'] * 0.5,
        'volume_drop_alert': baseline_metrics['volume_variance'] * 2
    }
    
    return scoring_thresholds
```

### 3.2 Business Impact Weighting

**Client-Specific Weight Adjustments:**

| Business Focus | Weight Adjustments | Rationale |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **High-Frequency Trading** | Timeliness × 1.5 | Latency critical |
| **Risk Management** | Accuracy × 1.3 | Precision critical |
| **Compliance Heavy** | Completeness × 1.2 | Audit requirements |
| **Multi-Asset** | Consistency × 1.4 | Cross-system sync |

### 3.3 Comparison Type Configuration

**Reference Source Mapping:**

```yaml
comparison_configurations:
  reference_tables:
    instrument_master: "BLOOMBERG_SYMBOLOGY"
    trader_directory: "HR_SYSTEM" 
    venue_codes: "FIX_STANDARD"
    
  golden_sources:
    pricing: "BLOOMBERG_PRICING"
    settlements: "SETTLEMENT_SYSTEM"
    positions: "POSITION_SYSTEM"
    
  cross_system_validation:
    trade_matching: ["OMS", "SETTLEMENT", "RISK"]
    position_reconciliation: ["TRADING", "ACCOUNTING", "RISK"]
    
  trend_baselines:
    volume_patterns: "90_DAY_ROLLING"
    timing_patterns: "30_DAY_AVERAGE"

## 🎯 Key Takeaways for Client Engagements

1. **Start with Discovery**: Understand current state before implementing
2. **Customize Configuration**: One-size-fits-all doesn't work for DQ
3. **Calibrate to Reality**: Use client's historical data to set realistic thresholds
4. **Phased Implementation**: Begin with fallback, evolve to role-aware
5. **Business Alignment**: Weight dimensions based on client's business priorities
6. **Continuous Improvement**: DQ frameworks require ongoing tuning and optimization

This framework provides a structured approach to implement DQSI effectively at any client site while ensuring the scoring reflects their specific business context and data quality maturity level.
