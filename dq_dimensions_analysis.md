# Data Quality (DQ) Dimensions and Subdimensions Analysis

## Overview

Based on the analysis of your Data Quality Sufficiency Index (DQSI) system, here are the comprehensive data quality dimensions and subdimensions that have been considered and implemented in your surveillance platform.

## Primary DQ Dimensions

The DQSI system uses **5 primary data quality dimensions** with configurable weights:

### 1. **Data Availability** (Weight: 30%)
- **Definition**: Completeness of required data elements
- **Calculation**: Ratio of non-null, meaningful data points to total expected data points
- **Subdimensions**:
  - Non-null data presence
  - Meaningful value detection (excludes empty strings, "Unknown" values)
  - Required field completeness
  - Data point coverage ratio

### 2. **Imputation Ratio** (Weight: 25%)
- **Definition**: Level of data imputation used in the dataset
- **Calculation**: Ratio of imputed data points to total data points
- **Subdimensions**:
  - Number of imputed fields
  - Imputation method quality
  - Original vs. imputed data ratio
  - Imputation confidence levels

### 3. **KDE Coverage** (Weight: 20%)
- **Definition**: Coverage of critical Key Data Elements
- **Calculation**: Ratio of present critical KDEs to total required KDEs
- **Subdimensions**:
  - Critical KDE presence
  - Optional KDE availability
  - KDE completeness scoring
  - Regulatory KDE compliance

### 4. **Temporal Consistency** (Weight: 15%)
- **Definition**: Data consistency and reliability over time
- **Calculation**: Assessment of data freshness, temporal alignment, and consistency
- **Subdimensions**:
  - Data recency and freshness
  - Timestamp alignment and gaps
  - Historical data consistency
  - Temporal data completeness
  - Volume-based consistency scoring

### 5. **Source Reliability** (Weight: 10%)
- **Definition**: Reliability and trustworthiness of data sources
- **Calculation**: Average reliability across all data sources
- **Subdimensions**:
  - Source credibility scores
  - Data source quality metrics
  - Historical source performance
  - Source validation status

## DQSI Trust Bucket Categorization

The system maps the weighted DQSI confidence index to human-readable trust categories:

| **Confidence Index Range** | **Trust Bucket** | **Description** |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 0.85 - 1.0 | **High** | Strong data quality confidence with comprehensive, reliable data |
| 0.65 - 0.84 | **Moderate** | Acceptable data quality with reasonable support but some gaps |
| 0.0 - 0.64 | **Low** | Limited data quality confidence requiring caution |

## Role-Aware Quality Requirements

Different user roles have varying data quality requirements and risk tolerances:

### Role-Specific Thresholds

| **Role** | **High Threshold** | **Moderate Threshold** | **Adjustment Factor** |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Analyst | 0.85 | 0.65 | 1.0 (baseline) |
| Senior Analyst | 0.87 | 0.67 | 0.98 |
| Supervisor | 0.88 | 0.68 | 0.95 |
| Compliance | 0.90 | 0.72 | 0.90 |
| Auditor | 0.92 | 0.75 | 0.85 |
| Trader | 0.83 | 0.63 | 1.05 |
| Portfolio Manager | 0.87 | 0.67 | 0.96 |
| Risk Manager | 0.89 | 0.70 | 0.92 |
| Regulatory | 0.91 | 0.74 | 0.88 |

### Role-Specific Quality Requirements

#### Compliance Officers
- **Minimum Confidence**: 80%
- **Required KDE Coverage**: 90%
- **Maximum Imputation Ratio**: 15%
- **Minimum Data Availability**: 90%

#### Auditors
- **Minimum Confidence**: 85%
- **Required KDE Coverage**: 95%
- **Maximum Imputation Ratio**: 10%
- **Minimum Data Availability**: 95%

#### Traders
- **Minimum Confidence**: 55%
- **Required KDE Coverage**: 60%
- **Maximum Imputation Ratio**: 40%
- **Minimum Data Availability**: 70%

#### Analysts (Baseline)
- **Minimum Confidence**: 60%
- **Required KDE Coverage**: 70%
- **Maximum Imputation Ratio**: 30%
- **Minimum Data Availability**: 75%

## Quality Assessment Components

### Data Quality Components Output
The system provides detailed breakdown of quality factors:

```json
{
  "data_quality_components": {
    "data_availability": 0.850,      // 85% data completeness
    "imputation_ratio": 0.200,       // 20% of data imputed
    "kde_coverage": 0.750,           // 75% KDE coverage
    "temporal_consistency": 0.700,   // 70% temporal consistency
    "source_reliability": 0.800      // 80% source reliability
  }
}
```

### Quality Summary Metrics
Additional metrics provided for comprehensive assessment:

- **Total Data Points**: Count of all data elements
- **Imputation Count**: Number of imputed data points
- **Missing KDEs**: Count of missing Key Data Elements
- **Reliability Score**: Human-readable reliability label (High/Medium/Low)

## Implementation Strategies

### 1. Standard DQSI Strategy
- Uses all 5 dimensions with standard weights
- Provides comprehensive quality assessment
- Suitable for normal operating conditions

### 2. Role-Aware Strategy
- Applies role-specific adjustments to confidence thresholds
- Customizes quality requirements based on user role
- Ensures appropriate risk tolerance alignment

### 3. Fallback Strategy
- Conservative scoring for degraded conditions
- Handles system failures gracefully
- Always ensures trust bucket categorization

## Quality Validation and Boundaries

### Boundary Test Cases
The system includes comprehensive testing for threshold boundaries:

- **High Boundary**: 0.85 exactly maps to "High" trust bucket
- **Moderate Boundary**: 0.65 exactly maps to "Moderate" trust bucket
- **Edge Cases**: 0.0 (minimum) and 1.0 (maximum) handled correctly
- **Precision**: All scores rounded to 3 decimal places

### Validation Rules
- Trust bucket values: `"High"`, `"Moderate"`, `"Low"` only
- Confidence index range: [0.0, 1.0]
- Component scores individually validated
- Role adjustments capped at maximum 1.0

## Future Enhancement Considerations

### Potential Additional Dimensions
Based on industry best practices, potential future dimensions could include:

1. **Data Lineage Quality** - Traceability and audit trail completeness
2. **Schema Compliance** - Adherence to expected data formats and structures
3. **Business Rule Validity** - Compliance with business logic and constraints
4. **Cross-Reference Integrity** - Consistency across related data sources
5. **Regulatory Compliance Score** - Specific regulatory requirement fulfillment

### Configuration Enhancements
- **Configurable Weights**: YAML-based dimension weight configuration
- **Custom Thresholds**: Organization-specific trust bucket boundaries
- **Dynamic Adjustments**: Real-time threshold adjustment based on system conditions
- **ML-Optimized Boundaries**: Machine learning-driven threshold optimization

## Conclusion

Your DQSI system implements a comprehensive 5-dimensional approach to data quality assessment with:
- **Weighted scoring** across complementary quality aspects
- **Role-aware adjustments** for different user requirements
- **Human-readable categorization** through trust buckets
- **Robust validation** and boundary testing
- **Flexible strategies** for various operational conditions

This framework provides a solid foundation for trustworthy data quality assessment in surveillance and risk management contexts.
