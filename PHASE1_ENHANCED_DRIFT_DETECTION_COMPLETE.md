    """Detect market regime changes based on volatility shifts."""
    current_volatility = current_data.get("market_volatility", 0)
    reference_volatility = reference_data.get("market_volatility", 0)
    
    if reference_volatility > 0:
        volatility_change = abs(current_volatility - reference_volatility) / reference_volatility
        return volatility_change > 0.5  # 50% volatility change threshold
    
    return False
```

#### Data Quality Assessment

def _predict_drift_score(self, historical_scores: List[float], horizon: int) -> float:
    """Predict future drift score using exponential smoothing."""
    if len(historical_scores) < 3:
        return np.mean(historical_scores) if historical_scores else 0.0
    
    # Exponential smoothing with trend adjustment
    alpha = 0.3
    forecast = historical_scores[0]
    
    for score in historical_scores[1:]:
        forecast = alpha * score + (1 - alpha) * forecast
    
    # Apply trend adjustment for horizon
    if len(historical_scores) > 5:
        recent_trend = np.mean(historical_scores[-3:]) - np.mean(historical_scores[-6:-3])
        forecast += recent_trend * (horizon / 7)
    
    return max(0.0, min(1.0, forecast))
