## Technical Implementation Details

### Node Classes Added:
1. **CounterpartyRelationshipNode** - States: [unrelated, connected, closely_related]
2. **RiskTransferAnalysisNode** - States: [genuine_transfer, limited_transfer, no_transfer]
3. **PriceNegotiationPatternNode** - States: [market_driven, coordinated, artificial]
4. **SettlementCoordinationNode** - States: [independent, synchronized, coordinated]
5. **BeneficialOwnershipNode** - States: [separate_ownership, shared_interests, common_ownership]
6. **TradeSequenceAnalysisNode** - States: [random_sequence, structured_sequence, circular_sequence]
7. **CoordinationLatentIntentNode** - States: [no_intent, potential_intent, clear_intent]

### Model Features:
- ✅ Both standard and latent intent Bayesian network variants
- ✅ Configurable risk thresholds and evidence weights
- ✅ Evidence sufficiency index (ESI) integration
- ✅ Fallback logic for missing evidence
- ✅ Comprehensive risk assessment with recommendations
- ✅ Full integration with existing system architecture

### Configuration Options:
- ✅ Risk thresholds: [low_risk: 0.30, medium_risk: 0.60, high_risk: 0.80]
- ✅ Evidence weights: Properly balanced with risk_transfer_analysis having highest weight (0.25)
- ✅ Model parameters: Counterparty relationship weight, risk transfer sensitivity, etc.
- ✅ Inference parameters: Variable elimination with convergence thresholds
- ✅ Fallback parameters: Configurable fallback logic behavior

## Registry Integration

### Available Models:
- ✅ `insider_dealing` - Enhanced insider dealing detection (Phase 1)

- ✅ `circular_trading` - Circular trading detection (Phase 3)
- ✅ `spoofing` - Spoofing detection (existing)
- ✅ `latent_intent` - Latent intent modeling (existing)

### Model Creation:
```python
# Registry usage example
registry = BayesianModelRegistry()
model = registry.create_model('circular_trading', {'use_latent_intent': True})
```
