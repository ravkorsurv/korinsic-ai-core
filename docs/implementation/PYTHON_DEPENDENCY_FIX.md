# Python Dependency Conflict Fix

## Issue Summary
The PR cursor/evaluate-openinference-utility-b9ad failed due to a Python version compatibility conflict with the arize-phoenix package.

### Root Cause
- Project constraint: python = "^3.8" (equivalent to >=3.8,<4.0)
- arize-phoenix requirement: Python <3.13,>=3.8
- Conflict: The project allowed Python 3.13+ but arize-phoenix doesn't support Python 3.13+

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Python Version Constraint in pyproject.toml
Changed from: python = "^3.8"
Changed to: python = ">=3.8,<3.13"

### 2. Updated CI/CD Pipeline to use Python 3.12
### 3. Updated Dockerfile to use Python 3.12
### 4. Added Python version requirements to README
### 5. Fixed Dockerfile CMD to use correct entry point

## Result
The project now explicitly supports Python 3.8-3.12, which is compatible with arize-phoenix requirements.
