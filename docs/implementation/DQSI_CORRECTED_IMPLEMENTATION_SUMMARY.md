# DQSI Corrected Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the corrected implementation of the Modular Data Quality Sufficiency Index (DQSI) based on the GitHub wiki requirements. The implementation addresses all identified gaps and issues from the original version.

## Key Corrections Made

### 1. ✅ Correct Dimension Count (7 dimensions, not 6)
**Original Issue**: Implementation had 6 dimensions
**Corrected**: Now properly implements 7 dimensions in 2 tiers:

- **Foundational Tier (4 dimensions)**: 
  - completeness
  - conformity  
  - timeliness
  - coverage

- **Enhanced Tier (3 dimensions)**:
  - accuracy
  - uniqueness
  - consistency

### 2. ✅ KDE-Level Scoring (not dimension-level)
**Original Issue**: Used fixed global weights for dimensions
**Corrected**: Implemented KDE-level scoring with risk-based weighting:

- Each KDE scored individually on [0.0 - 1.0] scale
- KDE risk tiers: high (weight: 3), medium (weight: 2), low (weight: 1)
- Weighted aggregation using KDE risk weights × dimension tier weights
- No global dimension weights (deprecated as per wiki)

### 3. ✅ Strategy-Based Architecture
**Original Issue**: Single monolithic approach
**Corrected**: Implemented strategy pattern with two modes:

- **Fallback Strategy**: Basic profiling for startups/light clients
- **Role-Aware Strategy**: Full-featured for banks/regulated institutions

### 4. ✅ Synthetic KDEs for System-Level Metrics
**Original Issue**: Missing synthetic KDE support
**Corrected**: Implemented synthetic KDEs for:

- **Timeliness KDE**: Feed delay monitoring with scoring bands
- **Coverage KDE**: Volume/value drop detection with baseline comparison
- Synthetic KDEs treated as regular KDEs in scoring

### 5. ✅ Critical KDE Cap Logic
**Original Issue**: No critical KDE handling
**Corrected**: Implemented critical KDE cap enforcement:

- Default critical KDEs: ['trader_id', 'order_timestamp']
- Critical cap: 0.75 (configurable)
- If any critical KDE fails, overall score capped at 0.75

### 6. ✅ Confidence Index Calculation
**Original Issue**: Missing confidence index
**Corrected**: Implemented comprehensive confidence calculation:

```python
base_confidence = (
    (kde_coverage + sub_dimension_fill) / 2
    - 0.05 * missing_critical_kdes
    - 0.1 * imputation_rate
)
dqsi_confidence_index = base_confidence * mode_modifier
```

### 7. ✅ Producer vs Consumer Role Logic
**Original Issue**: No role-based differentiation
**Corrected**: Implemented role-aware scoring:

- **Producer Role**: Comprehensive validation (accuracy, reconciliation, business rules)
- **Consumer Role**: Basic validation (completeness, conformity, basic rules)
- Different scoring weights and validation depth based on role

### 8. ✅ Alert/Case Integration
**Original Issue**: No integration with surveillance platform
**Corrected**: Implemented alert/case-specific methods:

- `calculate_dqsi_for_alert()`: Single alert scoring
- `calculate_dqsi_for_case()`: Multi-alert aggregation
- Proper field extraction and metadata handling
