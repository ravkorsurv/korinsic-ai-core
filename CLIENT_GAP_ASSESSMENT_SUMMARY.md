## üîç **Key Mixed-Role Configuration Elements**

The framework recognizes that clients operate **different roles simultaneously**:

### **A. Data Flow Role Mapping**
```yaml
# Example: Investment Bank Mixed-Role Architecture
data_flows:
  # CONSUMER FLOWS - Input validation focus
  market_data_feed:
    role: consumer
    source: "Bloomberg/Reuters"
    dimensions: [completeness, conformity, timeliness, coverage]
    
  trading_data_feed:
    role: consumer
    source: "OMS/Settlement"
    dimensions: [completeness, conformity, timeliness, coverage]
    
  # PRODUCER FLOWS - Full validation required
  surveillance_alerts:
    role: producer
    destination: "Case Management System"
    dimensions: [completeness, conformity, timeliness, coverage, accuracy, uniqueness, consistency]
    
  compliance_cases:
    role: producer
    destination: "Regulatory Reporting"
    dimensions: [completeness, conformity, timeliness, coverage, accuracy, uniqueness, consistency]
```

### **B. Role-Specific Strategy Assignment**
```yaml
# Flow-Specific Strategies
flow_strategies:
  # Consumer flows: Foundational dimensions (4 dimensions, 9 sub-dimensions)
  market_data_feed:
    strategy: role_aware_consumer
    subdimensions: 9
    validation_depth: input_validation
    comparison_types: [None, Reference Table]
    
  # Producer flows: Full validation (7 dimensions, 17 sub-dimensions)
  surveillance_alerts:
    strategy: role_aware_producer
    subdimensions: 17
    validation_depth: full_validation
    comparison_types: [None, Reference Table, Golden Source, Cross-System, Trend]
```

### **C. Flow-Specific KDE Mappings**
```yaml
# Consumer KDEs - Input validation only
trading_data_feed:
  trader_id: {risk: high, weight: 3, validation: input_only}
  trade_time: {risk: high, weight: 3, validation: input_only}
  notional: {risk: high, weight: 3, validation: input_only}
  
# Producer KDEs - Full validation required
surveillance_alerts:
  alert_id: {risk: high, weight: 3, validation: full_validation}
  alert_type: {risk: high, weight: 3, validation: full_validation}
  confidence_score: {risk: high, weight: 3, validation: full_validation}
```

### **D. Differential Thresholds**
```yaml
# Consumer flow thresholds - More lenient
trading_data_feed:
  acceptable_null_rate: 0.15
  acceptable_delay_minutes: 30
  format_error_threshold: 0.10
  
# Producer flow thresholds - Strict validation
surveillance_alerts:
  acceptable_null_rate: 0.05
  acceptable_delay_minutes: 10
  format_error_threshold: 0.02
  accuracy_threshold: 0.98
  uniqueness_threshold: 0.98
```

## üìä **Practical Mixed-Role Example**

### **Client: MidTier Investment Bank**
- **Consumer Flows**: market_data_feed, trading_data_feed, reference_data_feed
- **Producer Flows**: surveillance_alerts, compliance_cases
- **Mixed Assessment Results**:
  - Consumer Flow Average: 40% maturity (POOR)
  - Producer Flow Average: 41% maturity (POOR)
  - **Focus**: Balanced improvement across both roles

### **Generated Mixed-Role Configuration**
```yaml
mixed_role_configuration: true

# Consumer flows get foundational validation
market_data_feed:
  strategy: role_aware_consumer
  dimensions: [completeness, conformity, timeliness, coverage]
  kde_count: 9
  validation_depth: input_validation
  
# Producer flows get full validation
surveillance_alerts:
  strategy: role_aware_producer
  dimensions: [completeness, conformity, timeliness, coverage, accuracy, uniqueness, consistency]
  kde_count: 15
  validation_depth: full_validation

# Phase 1: Consumer flows (1-3 months)
# Phase 2: Producer foundation (4-6 months)  
# Phase 3: Producer enhanced (7-12 months)
# Phase 4: Optimization (13-18 months)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Mixed-Role Implementation Approach**

### **Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Consumer Data Flows**
```
‚Ä¢ Implement consumer strategy for input data flows
‚Ä¢ Basic KDE scoring for input validation
‚Ä¢ Completeness and conformity validation
‚Ä¢ Feed monitoring and alerting
```

### **Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Producer Data Flows Foundation**
```
‚Ä¢ Implement producer strategy for output data flows
‚Ä¢ Enhanced KDE scoring
‚Ä¢ Foundational dimensions (4 dimensions)
‚Ä¢ Basic output quality monitoring
```

### **Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Producer Data Flows Enhanced**
```
‚Ä¢ Full 7-dimension validation for produced data
‚Ä¢ Accuracy validation against golden sources
‚Ä¢ Cross-system consistency checking
‚Ä¢ Full regulatory compliance for outputs
```

### **Phase 4 (Months 13-18): Optimization and Integration**
```
‚Ä¢ Cross-flow consistency validation
‚Ä¢ Performance optimization
‚Ä¢ Advanced analytics and trending
‚Ä¢ Continuous improvement framework
```

## üéØ **Key Mixed-Role Benefits**

1. **Realistic Implementation**: Recognizes that clients have different validation needs for different data flows
2. **Resource Optimization**: Lighter validation for consumed data, full validation for produced data
3. **Phased Approach**: Start with consumer flows (lower risk), then enhance producer flows (higher risk)
4. **Business Impact Focus**: Producer data quality directly impacts client reputation and regulatory compliance
5. **Cost-Effective**: Avoids over-engineering consumer flows while ensuring producer flows meet regulatory standards

### **Key Files for Mixed-Role Implementation**:
- `CLIENT_DQ_GAP_ASSESSMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` - Complete mixed-role methodology
- `scripts/client_gap_assessment_tool.py` - Mixed-role assessment automation
- Generated mixed-role config files - Ready-to-deploy flow-specific DQSI configurations

This framework transforms the theoretical DQSI system into a **practical, flow-specific implementation** that recognizes the reality of mixed-role financial institutions where different data flows require different validation approaches based on their role as consumer or producer of data.
