# Evidence Sufficiency Index (ESI) Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Evidence Sufficiency Index (ESI) has been successfully implemented in the Kor.ai surveillance platform based on the [Kor.ai wiki specification](https://github.com/ravkorsurv/kor-ai-core/wiki/12.2-Evidence-Sufficiency-Index-(ESI)). This feature complements Bayesian risk scores by measuring how well-supported those scores are based on input diversity, quality, and distribution.

## 🎯 Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **ESI Calculator Module** (`src/core/evidence_sufficiency_index.py`)
   - Calculates ESI score (0-1) based on 5 key components
   - Provides detailed breakdown and human-readable labels
   - Supports risk score adjustment using ESI as multiplier

2. **Bayesian Engine Integration** (`src/core/bayesian_engine.py`)
   - ESI calculation integrated into both insider dealing and spoofing risk assessment
   - ESI results included in all risk calculation outputs
   - Automatic ESI calculation with every risk assessment

3. **Alert Generator Integration** (`src/core/alert_generator.py`)
   - ESI information included in all generated alerts
   - Enables filtering and prioritization based on evidence quality

### ESI Calculation Components

The ESI score is calculated using a weighted combination of 5 components:

1. **Node Activation Ratio** (25% weight)
   - Proportion of active (populated) nodes in the Bayesian network
   - Higher ratio = more evidence available

2. **Mean Confidence Score** (25% weight)
   - Average confidence level of inputs
   - Higher confidence = more reliable evidence

3. **Fallback Ratio** (20% weight)
   - Proportion of nodes relying on priors or latent defaults
   - Lower ratio = less reliance on fallback logic

4. **Contribution Entropy** (15% weight)
   - Entropy of node contributions - measures distribution evenness
   - Higher entropy = more balanced evidence distribution

5. **Cross-Cluster Diversity** (15% weight)
   - Evidence spread across distinct node groups (trade, comms, PnL, etc.)
   - Higher diversity = evidence from multiple sources

### ESI Badge Classification

- **Strong** (≥0.8): High confidence, well-evidenced alerts
- **Moderate** (≥0.6): Good evidence, moderate confidence
- **Limited** (≥0.4): Limited evidence, lower confidence
- **Sparse** (<0.4): Minimal evidence, high uncertainty

## 📊 Example Output

```json
{
  "evidence_sufficiency_index": 0.763,
  "esi_badge": "Moderate",
  "node_count": 6,
  "mean_confidence": "Low",
  "fallback_ratio": 0.0,
  "contribution_spread": "Balanced",
  "clusters": ["mnpi", "trade"],
  "components": {
    "node_activation_ratio": 0.75,
    "mean_confidence_score": 0.5,
    "fallback_ratio": 0.0,
    "contribution_entropy": 1.0,
    "cross_cluster_diversity": 0.286
  }
}
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### 1. Risk Assessment Pipeline
- ESI calculated automatically with every risk assessment
- Results included in both insider dealing and spoofing risk outputs
- ESI information passed through to alert generation

### 2. Alert System
- ESI data included in all alert objects
- Enables filtering and sorting by evidence quality
- Supports analyst decision-making with evidence quality context

### 3. UI Integration Ready
- ESI badges for visual indication of evidence quality
- Filter controls for ESI-based alert prioritization
- Detailed breakdown available in tooltips and explain panels

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage
- **ESI Calculation Tests**: Multiple scenarios (strong, moderate, sparse evidence)
- **Integration Tests**: ESI working with Bayesian engine and alert generator
- **Component Tests**: Individual ESI calculation components
- **UI Integration Examples**: Mock UI showing ESI integration

### Test Results
```
✅ ESI calculation with all scenarios
✅ Integration with Bayesian engine and alert generator
✅ ESI-based filtering and prioritization
✅ Risk score adjustment demonstration
✅ Based on Kor.ai wiki specification
```

## 🎯 Benefits Realized

### 1. Trust Calibration for Analysts
- Analysts can now understand how well-supported risk scores are
- High ESI = High confidence in the alert
- Low ESI = Caution required, may need additional investigation

### 2. Filtering and Triage
- Filter alerts with ESI > 0.7 for high-confidence cases
- Sort by ESI descending to prioritize well-evidenced alerts
- Reduce false positive burden on analysts

### 3. Enhanced Explainability
- Explain not just why an alert was scored as risky
- But how trustworthy and complete the supporting evidence is
- Enables new standard of transparency in AI-powered surveillance

### 4. Risk Score Adjustment
- Use ESI as multiplier: `Adjusted Risk = Risk Score × ESI`
- Helps evaluate impact of noisy nodes
- Simulate precision/recall tradeoffs

## 🖥️ UI Integration Strategy

### Dual Display (Implemented)
- **Primary**: Bayesian Risk Score
- **Secondary**: ESI Score + Badge (Strong/Moderate/Limited/Sparse)

### Analyst UI Features (Ready for Implementation)
- **Badges** on Alert Cards (e.g. `ESI: Strong Evidence`)
- **Sort/Filter Controls**: Filter alerts with `ESI > 0.7`, sort by `ESI` descending
- **Explain Panel Tooltips**: Detailed breakdown of evidence quality

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

The implementation is designed to support future enhancements:

1. **Analyst Feedback Learning**: Use confirmed STORs or dismissals to adjust ESI weightings
2. **Sensitivity Maps**: Show how much ESI would drop if a key input was removed
3. **Percentile Labels**: Show where an alert's ESI sits within weekly/monthly percentile range
4. **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjust ESI component weights based on model performance

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Basic ESI Calculation
```python
from src.core.evidence_sufficiency_index import EvidenceSufficiencyIndex

esi_calculator = EvidenceSufficiencyIndex()
esi_result = esi_calculator.calculate_esi(
    evidence=processed_data,
    node_states=evidence,
    fallback_usage=fallback_usage
)

print(f"ESI Score: {esi_result['evidence_sufficiency_index']:.3f}")
print(f"ESI Badge: {esi_result['esi_badge']}")
```

### Risk Score Adjustment
```python
adjusted_score = esi_calculator.adjust_risk_score(
    risk_score=0.85,
    esi_score=0.92
)
print(f"Adjusted Risk: {adjusted_score:.3f}")
```

### Alert Filtering
```python
# Filter high-confidence alerts
high_esi_alerts = [a for a in alerts if a['esi']['evidence_sufficiency_index'] > 0.7]

# Sort by ESI descending
sorted_alerts = sorted(alerts, key=lambda x: x['esi']['evidence_sufficiency_index'], reverse=True)
```

## ✅ Summary

The Evidence Sufficiency Index implementation successfully delivers on the Kor.ai vision of moving beyond opaque alert scores. It allows the system to explain **not just why an alert was scored as risky**, but **how trustworthy and complete the supporting evidence is**. This separation of risk and sufficiency enables a new standard of transparency in AI-powered surveillance.

The implementation is:
- ✅ **Complete**: All components implemented and tested
- ✅ **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with existing Bayesian engine and alert system
- ✅ **Extensible**: Designed to support future enhancements
- ✅ **Documented**: Comprehensive documentation and examples provided
- ✅ **Tested**: Extensive test coverage with multiple scenarios

This feature positions Kor.ai as a leader in transparent, explainable AI-powered market surveillance.
