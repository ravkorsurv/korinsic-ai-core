"""
Commodity Manipulation Detection Model Package.

This package contains the complete implementation of the commodity manipulation
detection model for identifying artificial price movements in commodity markets.

Commodity manipulation involves coordinated efforts to artificially influence
commodity prices through various strategies including cornering markets,
spreading false information, or coordinated trading activities. This model
detects such patterns through analysis of:
- Market concentration and position accumulation
- Price movement patterns relative to fundamentals
- Trading volume and timing analysis
- Cross-market correlation and arbitrage patterns

Design Rationale:
- Specialized algorithms for commodity market characteristics
- Integration with fundamental data and market indicators
- Multi-timeframe analysis for different manipulation strategies
- Risk scoring based on market impact and position concentration

Version: 1.0.0 - Core commodity manipulation detection capabilities
Compliance: Designed for commodity market regulatory oversight and reporting
