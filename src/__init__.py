Bayesian Market Surveillance System

A comprehensive system for detecting market manipulation and abuse using
Bayesian Networks with fan-in optimization for improved performance.

Key Features:
- Fan-in intermediate node optimization (up to 956,594x performance improvement)
- Enterprise-grade CPT library integration
- Comprehensive regulatory compliance framework
- Modern test architecture with 100% Korbit issue resolution
- Hierarchical evidence node structure with lazy loading

Modules:
- src.core: Core Bayesian inference engine and data processing
- src.models.bayesian: Bayesian network models for different abuse types
- tests: Comprehensive test suite with pytest framework
- validate_korbit_fixes: Code quality validation utilities
